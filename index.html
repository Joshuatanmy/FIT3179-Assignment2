          <p>The global obesity epidemic is well established, with increases in obesity prevalence for most countries since the 1980s. Obesity contributes directly to incident cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and sleep disorders. </p>

          <h2>Australian Physical guideline indicator</h2>
          <p style="display: inline;">In 2022, based on self-reported data from the ABS 2022 NHS, 57% of adults aged 65 and over were insufficiently physically active. This was higher in <p style="color: palevioletred;display: inline;">women</p> (60%) than <p style="color: #3b588f; display: inline;">men</p> (53%) 
          </p>
          <p>For people aged 18-64, 'insufficient physical activity' is defined as not completing 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity across 5 or more days a week.
              In 2022, it is estimated that 78% of adults aged 18-64 were insufficiently physically active and also did not meet the muscle-strengthening component of the physical activity guidelines.
              <br><br>There has been a large decrease in the proportion of adults aged 18 and over who did not meet the physical activity guidelines to 46% in 2022, from 65% in 2017-18. This followed from the slight decreasing trends observed since 2007-08.

            <h2>Analysing the effectiveness of workouts</h2>
            <p> 
                It's been established that obesity is a link to diabetes, so to reduce the risk of diabetes, it makes sense to lose fat.
                A common method of doing so is to burn more calories than you eat. The visualisation demonstrates the correlation between the duration
                you spend in the gym, and the amount of calories you burn as a result. (click the workout types on the legend to filter them)
            </p>
            <p> 
                The type of exercise can also affect the number of calories you burn while exercising. Yoga seems to be the best at burning calories for a shorter duration of workout, but as you reach a workout length of 1.4 hours, 
                strength training seems to become the better alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workout frequency also reveals that individuals who work out more frequently tend to spend a longer time in the gym for each session, which might
              encourage us to continue to be consistent when trying to lose weight.
